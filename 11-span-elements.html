    <!-- Paragraph with three span elements for different text parts -->
    <p>
        My daily routine includes <span>morning exercise</span>, followed by 
        <span>study sessions</span>, and ends with <span>project work</span>. 
        Each part of my day is carefully planned to maximize productivity.
