        <p>Web development has evolved tremendously over the past two decades. From simple static HTML pages to complex dynamic applications, the journey has been remarkable. Today, developers have access to powerful frameworks and tools that make building web applications faster and more efficient than ever before.</p>

        <p>The rise of <mark>JavaScript frameworks</mark> like React, Vue, and Angular has transformed how we build user interfaces. These frameworks provide component-based architecture, making code more modular and reusable. Developers can now create single-page applications that offer seamless user experiences without page reloads.</p>

        <p>Another significant trend is the adoption of <mark>serverless architecture</mark> and cloud computing. Services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions allow developers to build and deploy applications without managing servers. This shift has reduced infrastructure costs and improved scalability.</p>

        <p>Responsive design has become a standard practice in modern web development. With the increasing use of mobile devices, websites must adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have made responsive design more accessible to developers.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, technologies like <mark>WebAssembly</mark>, Progressive Web Apps, and AI integration are shaping the future of web development. WebAssembly enables near-native performance in browsers, while PWAs bridge the gap between web and mobile applications. The integration of artificial intelligence is opening new possibilities for personalized user experiences.</p>
