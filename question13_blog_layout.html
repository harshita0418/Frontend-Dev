            <h2>My First Blog</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-10">January 10, 2025</time>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I am excited to start this journey of sharing my experiences and learnings in the field of computer science. As a third-year B.Tech CSE student at GLA University, I have been exploring various technologies and programming languages. This blog will be a platform where I document my projects, challenges, and the lessons I learn along the way.</p>

            <h2>Things I Learned This Week</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-12">January 12, 2025</time>
            <p>This week has been incredibly productive. I dove deep into HTML5 semantic elements and learned how to structure web pages properly. Understanding the difference between block and inline elements was enlightening. I also explored tables, forms, and various HTML attributes. Additionally, I practiced creating different layouts and learned the importance of clean, well-structured code.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Every day is a learning opportunity. The more I code, the more I realize how much there is to learn. The key is to stay consistent and curious.</p>
