            <h2>The Art of Web Typography</h2>
            
            <p class="intro">Typography is one of the most important aspects of web design. It affects readability, user experience, and the overall aesthetic of a website. Good typography creates hierarchy, guides the reader's eye, and makes content easier to consume.</p>

            <p>Web fonts have revolutionized online typography. Designers now have access to thousands of typefaces through services like Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts. This has enabled <strong>creative freedom</strong> and allowed websites to establish unique visual identities.</p>

            <p>The key principles of typography include <em>hierarchy</em>, <mark>contrast</mark>, and alignment. Hierarchy helps readers understand which content is most important. Line height and letter spacing significantly impact readability, especially for body text.</p>

            <p>Responsive typography adapts to different screen sizes using relative units like <strong>em and rem</strong>. This ensures text remains readable on devices ranging from smartphones to large desktop monitors. Modern CSS provides powerful tools for <mark>fluid typography</mark> that scales smoothly.</p>

            <p>Color and typography work together to create visual harmony. High contrast between text and background improves accessibility. Professional designers carefully select typeface pairings that complement each other while maintaining <em>readability and elegance</em>.</p>
